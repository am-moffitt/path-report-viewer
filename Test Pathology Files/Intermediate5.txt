Surgical Pathology Report

Patient Information:

Name: Thomas Miller
Age: 72
Sex: Male
Medical Record Number: 98765
Date of Surgery: November 18, 2024
Referring Physician: Dr. Williams
Clinical Information:
The patient presented with increased PSA levels, which prompted further diagnostic evaluation. A biopsy of the prostate confirmed the presence of carcinoma. A radical prostatectomy was recommended to address the malignancy.

Procedure Description:
The patient underwent a radical prostatectomy to excise the prostate and adjacent structures. The surgical specimen, including periprostatic tissue and lymph nodes, was submitted for analysis.

Gross Examination:
The prostate specimen was received in a well-oriented manner and measured approximately 7.2 cm x 5.0 cm x 3.0 cm. A firm, irregularly shaped tumor mass was noted within the gland. The surrounding tissue appeared relatively uninvolved, and lymph nodes were dissected separately for further examination.

Histological Findings:
Microscopic evaluation reveals an invasive prostate adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells show irregular glandular formation with prominent nucleoli and moderate pleomorphism. The Gleason grade is 4+5, corresponding to a high-grade malignancy. There is no evidence of perineural invasion, and the surgical margins are negative. Lymph node assessment reveals no metastatic involvement.

Staging and Final Diagnosis:
The tumor is confined to the prostate gland, with no extension into adjacent structures. No evidence of regional or distant metastasis was noted.

Summary:

The prostate tissue is involved by a moderately aggressive adenocarcinoma, as reflected by the Gleason score.
The tumor remains localized to the prostate, with no evidence of extra-capsular spread.
There is no lymph node involvement, indicating a potentially favorable prognosis.
